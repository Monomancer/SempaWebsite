About the Game: Our original goal was to make 2d platformer RPG style game with lots of procedural or random generation to increase replayability<br>
<br>
We had some influences like Maple Story, Candybox, and Ori and the Blind Forest.
<br>
This turned out to be a difficult task however, since none of us have had any experience with anything similar.
<br>
We are continually working to try to add things to this game but right now we have focused mostly on breadth rather than depth.
<br>
That is, we added in many features (questing, leveling systel, monsters that attack you, health and damage tracker, and NPCs for example)
<br>
but we have not added to those features yet (for example there is only one monster currently but now that we have the framework in place it should be easy to add more)
<br>
